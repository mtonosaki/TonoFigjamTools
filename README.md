## Digital Kanban Post
FigJam Auto-Kanban Layout  

A FigJam plugin that automatically organizes and aligns sticky notes within specific sections.
Turn your messy brainstorming board into a clean, structured Kanban board instantly.

### Features

- **Auto-Alignment**: Automatically snaps sticky notes into a clean vertical list when placed inside a target section.
- **Magnetic "Snap"**: Just drop a sticky note near a section, and it gets sucked in and aligned.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: The section height automatically adjusts based on the number of sticky notes.
- **User-Friendly**: Sorting pauses while you are dragging/selecting a sticky note, preventing accidental movements during edits.
- **Multi-Column Support**: Works with multiple sections independently (e.g., Todo, Doing, Done).

### How to Use

### 1. Create a Section
Create a standard Section in FigJam.

### 2. Name the Section with a `♻️` Prefix
Rename the section so it starts with a recycle mark (`♻️`).
The plugin **only** monitors sections with this specific naming convention.

**Examples:**
- `♻️To Do`
- `♻️In Progress`
- `♻️Done`
- `Trash`  ... not auto arrange target

### 3. Drop Sticky Notes
Drag and drop any sticky note into the section. It will automatically align to the grid.
